# Logo and Trademark Policy

The brand name Jamku and the logo are trademarks of Madrecha Solutions Pvt Ltd

## Introduction

Madrecha Solutions Pvt Ltd (Madrecha Solutions) owns and oversees the trademarks for the Jamku name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the Jamku name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve Jamku.
- We’d like to make it clear how Jamku-related softwares/solutions/tools and projects can (and cannot) use the Jamku name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the Jamku name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official Jamku resources.

## Madrecha Solutions Trademark Usage Policy

Permission from Madrecha Solutions is required to use the Jamku name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain or company name.

We will grant permission to use the Jamku name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

- The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the Jamku software.
- Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).
Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which Jamku's project may be distributed.
- If your project meets these criteria, you may be permitted to use the Jamku name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception: Please do not use Jamku as part of a domain name.

Use of the Jamku name and logo is additionally allowed in the following situations:

All other Jamku-related businesses or projects can use the Jamku name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by Jamku or Madrecha Solutions Technologies or the Jamku open source project. For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering Jamku consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The Jamku Consulting Company.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the Jamku logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use Jamku as part of a top-level domain name.

We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around Jamku. We encourage Jamku-based businesses, and we would love to see hundreds of them.

When in doubt about your use of the Jamku name or logo, please contact Madrecha Solutions (jamku.support[at]madrecha.com) for clarification.
